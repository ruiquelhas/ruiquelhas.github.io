            So, Node.js is basically JavaScript in the server. It's a runtime environment on top of
            Google's V8, which is the JavaScript engine ("compiler") powering Google Chrome. Node.js is written
            partially in JavaScript and partially in C/C++. V8 is wirtten in C++.
        </p>
        <p>
            "In the server" means that HTTP is a first-class citizen, which means you can spin up a Node.js app
            (which can be just a simple script) and start listening to HTTP requests and send out responses without
            the need for an application server or any specific external tool like nginx or Apache.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also means, of course, that it provides filesystem and network APIs as well as other things like
            out-of-the-box TLS and encryption support via OpenSSL and compression with zlib.
        </p>
        <p>
            These APIs are usually stream-based, which means you can use them to compose small and
            self-contained modules or functions that work together to achieve bigger purposes, similar to
            the unix philosophy, and the use of unix pipes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Node.js provides an event-loop to handle blocking I/O operations outside the main execution scope
            (more on this in a minute).
        </p>
        <p>
            If JS does not cut it, you can always write code in C or C++ and easily plug it in your Node.js project
            through an addon, and use it like any other module through V8 and the available bindings.
        </p>
        <p>
            Speaking about modules, Node.js unifies the module system by providing the same interface to access
            both internal and external (3rd-party) modules via the CommonJS standard and NPM (Node Package Manager).
        </p>
        <p>
            NPM is an essential piece in the process of developing Node.js applications. Besides being
            the module system glue, it also works for other things such as downloading and installing
            dependencies, running tests, setting up build systems/pipelines and tapping into the npm registry,
            which is the largest repository of language-specific open source libraries in the world (currently
            hosting more than half a milion packages).

    <p>Programming model</p>

        <li>Single-threaded environment (it's JavaScript after all)</li>
        <li>Asynchronous callback-based core</li>
        <li>Non-blocking operations run immediatelly and sequentially</li>

    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        <p>
            Since JavaScript (the runtime) is single threaded, multi-tasking is achieved through the use of an
            event loop (which is implemented by libuv, a C library that is part of node core).
        </p>
        <p>
            The event loop is basically a loop that runs outside the runtime execution scope, checks if the
            call stack is empty and picks tasks that have been queued by some API, runs them and pushes the
            result back into the stack. The event loop should, in the best case scenario, handle all blocking
            (thus asynchronous) operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            These tasks are deferred to the event loop by registering a callback (which is just a plain function)
            that should be called when the result of an asynchronous operation is ready. This is the way things work
            on the core library, but there are a few abstractions over this pattern that I'll describe in a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Non-blocking operations such as CPU-bound tasks, memory access, etc. run immediatelly and sequentially
            (as soon as the instructions get evaluated). Whereas blocking operations such as network/disk access,
            asynchronous in nature, should be handled eventually by the event loop, outside the main execution scope.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite being single threaded, real concurrency can be achieved through V8 (and C++ threads) or by
            spinning up additional Node.js processes (similar to other scripting languages). This is useful for
            handling stuff like CPU intensive workloads without blocking I/O operations.

            This is just a naive async-like function which delays the execution of something.

            <span class="inline">setTimeout()</span> "triggers" the process of deferring a task to

            Follow the error-first pattern, because that's the flavour used in the core library,

            Promises, unlinke the previous two, are a language construct.
        </p>
        <p>
            They are available because V8 supports a version of ECMAScript (the JS standard)
            that provides their specification.
        </p>
        <p>
            They were introduced to appease people who think callbacks were confusing, but
            I think they might be even more confusing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Provide a standard API to handle results and errors of asynchronous operations,
            trough the <span class="inline">then()</span> and <span class="inline">catch()</span> methods.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both methods get passed (you've guessed it) a callback handler, albeit one with
            a standard signature (just a single parameter).
        </p>
        <p>
            These abstractions are all push-based in nature, because the control is passed
            to the producer of the result.

        <p>
            It's basically syntatic sugar for promises. It wraps the outcome of an asynchronous
            operation in a way that can be handled by the caller as if it was a synchronous.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that in order for this to work, we need to wrap instructions that use "await"
            inside an "async" function block.
